            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

intend brevity; In the 7th. page of the Doctors booke, <hi>There is a twofold
Que≈øtion betweene them called</hi> PRESBYTERIANS <hi>and their Brethren who
are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> INDEPENDENTS; <hi>The fir≈øt is, concerning the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church,</hi> viz. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be</hi> Presbyterian-Dependen,
<hi>or</hi> Presbyterian-Independent? <hi>The ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Que≈øtion is,
concerning the Gathering of</hi> CHURCHES.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:113091:3"/>Touching the former Que≈øtion concerning the
Government of the Church, the Doctor acknowledgeth in the ≈øame 7th. page,
<hi>that the Brethren on both ≈øides agree, that the Government of the church
is a Pre≈øbyterian-Government, both acknowledging a Pre≈øby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie.</hi> But
whether it be Dependent, or Independent is the maine thing in the que≈øtion,
which the Doctor doth determine, and ≈øaith in the Title page of his book he
hath evidently Proved. '<hi>That the Pre≈øbyterian-Government-Dependent is
Gods Ordinance, and not the byterian-Government-Independent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I intend not to ≈øtrive with the Doctor about wordes, and
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore touching the two Termes, to wit, Dependent, and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; I
≈øhall onely ≈øay this at pre≈øent: That if by Independent the the Doctor
indeede mean (as it doth appear ≈øo to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding by many
pa≈ø≈øages in his booke, he doth intend) a Pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian-Government, which
hath not Dependencie upon any in matters meerly Eccle≈øia≈øticall (but upon
the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, Who is the Head of the Church) And if by Dependent
hee al≈øo indendeth (as in many other pa≈ø≈øages in his booke ≈øeemeth to
me to be his meaning)<note place="margin">Pag. 8.10. Pag. 14.15.17.18.</note> a
Presbyterian-Government, which hath a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencie upon a ≈øupream Judicature
of a Common-councell of Presbyters, and who mu≈øt in matters
Eccle≈øia≈øticall be ≈øubiect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Decrees, Sentences, Con≈øtitutions,
and Commandments of a Common-councell, Colledge or Con≈øi≈øtorie of
Cla≈ø≈øicall, Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, or Synodicall Presbyters; Then I do conceive the
Doctor hath not proved, (nor will he ever be able to prove) That the
Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian-Government-Dependent is Gods Ordinance; And I hope to make the
contrary plainly appear both from cleere Texts of Scripture, and the Doctors
owne bookes. And ≈øeeing that the Doctor hath in the 6th. p. of his Book
de≈øired all his Chri≈øtan Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the Deciding of this Que≈øtion to
take the Word of God into their Hands, and with the Noble <hi>Bereans</hi> to
≈øit downe and examine, what≈øoever ≈øhall be ≈øaid on either ≈øide
according to the Scriptures: I willingly make the ≈øame reque≈øt, as mo≈øt
de≈øirous, that this ≈øhort An≈øwere may abide the like triall, and be
weighed in the other ballance of the Sanctuary again≈øt the Doctors Booke.</p>
            <p>Now that all things may be handled in good order, and in a 
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113091:3"/>Methodicall way, the Doctor hath reduced the whole
di≈øputation concerning this fir≈øt Que≈øtion into four Propo≈øitions,
page. 11. 
<list>
                  <item>The fir≈øt, that there were many Congregations and
≈øeverall a≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Beleevers in the church of Ieru≈øalem, in the
which they enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all acts of Wor≈øhip, and all the Ordinances among≈øt
them≈øelves, and did partake of all acts of Church-fellow≈øhip, e≈øpecially
of preaching, and in the Admini≈øtration of the Sacraments, and prayer, and
that before the Per≈øecution we reade of, Act. 8.2.</item>
                  <item>The ≈øecond, That all the≈øe congregations, and
≈øeverall a≈ø≈øemblies made but one church.</item>
                  <item>The third, That the Apo≈øtles and Elders governed,
ordered, and ruled this church joyntly, and by a Common-councell, and
Preb≈øytery.</item>
                  <item>The fourth, that this church of Ieru≈øalem, and the
government of the ≈øame is to be a patterne for all ≈øeverall congregations
and a≈ø≈øemblies in any City or Vicinity to unite into one Church, and for
the Officers of tho≈øe congregations to governe that Church joyntly in a
Colledge or Pre≈øbyterie.</item>
               </list> The≈øe are his four Propo≈øitions.</p>
            <p>But before hee comes to the proof of the≈øe particulars hee
≈øaith it will not bee ami≈ø≈øe in generall to take notice, <hi>That all the
Churches we read of in the New Te≈øtament, were</hi> Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtocratically
<hi>and</hi> Pre≈øtbyterially <hi>governed, and were all Dependent upon their
≈øeverall</hi> Presbyters, <hi>and produceth divers places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to
prove the ≈øame,</hi> and two ≈øheets are ≈øpent wholly in proving thereof
from the 12. page to the 29. All which (≈øhould it bee granted) only proves.
Fir≈øt, That in every City or Church there was a Presbiterie, Acts. 14.23.

≈øtatui≈ø≈øent illis per ≈øingulas Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle≈øias ≈øeniores,</hi> that is,
When they had ordained them Elders in every Church by the Suffrage or

            <p>Secondly, that as there were Apo≈øtles and Elders in the Church
of Jeru≈øalem, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.2,4. So there were Elders in the Church of
Ephe≈øus, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17,28. And in the Church of Corinth, and in the
Church of Galatia, and in Philippie, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the≈øe ≈øeverall Churches were Dependent upon 
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113091:4"/>their ≈øeverall Presbyters, and were to obey them who had
the rule over them, Heb. 13.7,17,24. Or who were their Guides,

               </gap>, <hi>Obedite ducibus
ve≈øtris,</hi> that is Obey your Guides.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that this Presbyterian-Church-Government, God hath hath
appointed as his Ordinance, to be continued to the end of the world, the which
who≈øoever re≈øi≈øteth, re≈øi≈øteth the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, but it doth not
prove, That this Presbyterian-Church-Government is Dependent upon a ≈øupreame
Judicature of a Common-coun≈øell of Presbyters, or that they mu≈øt ≈øubmit,
and ≈øubject them them≈øelves and their churches unto the Decrees, Sentences,
Con≈øtitutions, and Commandements, of a Common-councell, colledge, and court
of cla≈ø≈øicall, or Synodall Presbyters, which the Doctor ≈øhould have
proved, for ≈øuch a Presbyterian-Government he intends, as may appeare by the
Doctors owne words, pag. 17.18. <hi>As for the Pre≈øbyterian Government (in
the ≈øence that I under≈øtand it) there is nothing more cleare to me in all
the Scripture: Yea the very word and name of Pre≈øbytery ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, a
Magi≈øtracy, or Ari≈øtocracy, or Signory, or court. And as the word is taken
in the civill Polity and Government, ≈øo in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle≈øia≈øticall, by a
Pre≈øbytery wee under≈øtand</hi> (≈øaith the Doctor) <hi>page</hi> 18. <hi>A
Religious, Grave, Sollid, Learned, and Wi≈øe Councell of Divines, Mini≈øters,
&amp;c. Without who≈øe joynt and mutuall accord, or agreement and
common-con≈øent nothing ought to be done or tran≈øacted of publicke
concernment. And to make this good,</hi> to wit, That the Presbyters of
particular congregations or a≈ø≈øemblies of Beleevers, and their Churches
ought to be ≈øubject to a Common-councell or Court of Presbyters. The Doctor
urgeth that Scripture, the third Epi≈øtle of John, the 9.10,11. ver≈øes, as
an invincible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>You ≈øhall finde it thus expounded by the Doctor pag. 15. 
<q rend="inline">'And therefore when <hi>Diotrephes</hi>
a≈ø≈øumed to him≈øelf, and his particular congregation a power and authority
to rule according to his will and plea≈øure, without the con≈øent of the
Presbyterie, and oppo≈øed <hi>Iohn</hi> the Presbyter, He ≈øharply reproves
his proceedings, and ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to the Church; That when he came he would
remember<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113091:4"/>his words, and teach him how to prate again≈øt the
Presbytery with malicious words; Which is an evill thing in him ≈øaith St.
<hi>Iohn.</hi> It was evill in him to a≈ø≈øume unto him≈øelf, and his
parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular congregation, that power that belonged unto the colledge or
councell of Presbyters, and was to be moderated and exerci≈øed onely by the
conjoynt, and common-con≈øent of the Presbytery. For God hath appointed, that
the Church ≈øhould be governed by a Presbytery; and <hi>Diotrephes</hi> would
have his congregation In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, and have an ab≈øolute jurisdiction within

≈øeeing no mention is made of any perticular Congregation, how can the Dr.

Reader may ≈øee plainly, That the Dr. can expound tho≈øe Brethren and their
Elders or Presbyters, which the Scripture calles a Church, to be a particular
Congregation. And what it was which St. <hi>Iohn</hi> had written to the Church
is not in this Epi≈øtle, nor any other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, declared, except it was, to
receive tho≈øe Brethren, which he ≈øaith ver≈øe 8. ought to be received, and
ver≈øe 10. whom <hi>Diotrephes</hi> would not receive, how then doth the
Doctor ≈øay? <hi>That</hi> Diotre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes <hi>a≈ø≈øumed that power to

and neither the one nor the other may be tran≈øacted by the Elders and
Brethren of a particular congregation, unle≈ø≈øe the court or common-councell

pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition of this Argument. Neither hath the Doctor proved, That there was
an infinite number of Beleevers, nor a very City of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in the Church of
Jeru≈øalem. The Scriptures quoted by the Doctor ≈øpeakes no ≈øuch thing;
tho≈øe places in <hi>Matthew, Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> tell us of very
many who were baptized by <hi>Iohn,</hi> and by Chri≈øts Di≈øciples, but do
not declare how many of the≈øe baptized per≈øons were of the Church in

Churches throughout all Judaea, as well as in Jeru≈øalem, and for ought I

tho≈øe 120. mentioned Acts 1.13,14,15. To whom were added about 3000. ≈øouls,
who continued in the Apo≈øtles Doctrine, and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip, and in breaking of

≈øay they beleeved in him, much le≈ø≈øe that there was a world of Beleevers

by the Doctor of <pb n="9" facs="tcp:113091:6"/>8000. new Converts be≈øides women and
children. Neither doth that Scripture produced Acts 4.4 prove any ≈øuch thing:
For the Reader may con≈øider that the number of them there mentioned are but
5000. And albeit the Doctor make them up 8000. by ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tho≈øe 5000. men
were added to the Church, and joyned to the formers Beleevers pag. 57. Yet
there is a twofold mi≈øtake in the Doctors Addition, to wit; Fir≈øt, that
≈øome of the 3000. (may be) were women, and how then can the Doctor ≈øay,
there were 8000. new converts be≈øides women. Secondly, the≈øe 5000. are
onely cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led men and not converts, not beleevers. For howbeit many of them

<q rend="inline">'pag. 62. to wit, Acts 1. ver≈ø. 21.22. cap. 6.
ver≈ø. 2.4. and cap. 8. ver≈ø. 1. That there was almo≈øt a hundred Preachers
and Mini≈øters be≈øides the 12. Apo≈øtles in the Church of Jeru≈øalem.</q>
The 12. are named indeed in Act. 6.2.4. but not 100. be≈øides, no nor any one
Preacher but them 12. And as for the other two places Acts 1.21.22. and Acts
8.1. there is not any word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Preachers or Mini≈øters, onely ≈øome
directions touching the choi≈øe of <hi>Matthias,</hi> who was one of the 12.
mentioned Act. 6.2. And although they who were ≈øcattered preached the Word
Acts 8.4. yet the Scripture doth not declare that they were Preachers or
Mini≈øters of the Church in Jeru≈øalem.</p>
            <p>But the Doctor hath one Argument, which is more to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe 
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113091:7"/>then all the other, which I de≈øire the Reader
≈øeriou≈øly to con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, pag. 64. he thus further argueth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That, which the Holy Scripture in expre≈ø≈øe wordes, and in
divers places hath declalred unto us, that every Chri≈øtian is bound to
beleeve. But the Scripture in expre≈ø≈øe words, and in diver≈øe, places hath
decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto us, that there were divers a≈ø≈øemblies, and Congregations of
Beleevers in the Church of Ieru≈øalem, and that the Apo≈øtles, and all the
Beleevers in Ieru≈øalem, did continue daily with one accord in the Temple, and
that they brake bread from hou≈øe to hou≈øe: and that daily in the Temple,
and in every hou≈øe, they cea≈øad not to teach and preach Ie≈øus
Chri≈øt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ergo, <hi>There was diver≈øe congregations, and ≈øeverall
a≈ø≈øemblies, of Beleevers in the</hi> CHURCH <hi>of Ieru≈øalem, where they
did duly pertake in all the Ordinances, and injoyed all the acts of
Wor≈øhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I doe de≈øire the Reader to con≈øider how the Doctor Proves
his Minor, <hi>which he ≈øaith is manife≈øt from</hi> Acts 2.46. <hi>and
chap.</hi> 5.12,42. <hi>and chap.</hi> 3.11.12. <hi>and many more places, that
might be produced, pag.</hi> 64.65.66. In all which di≈øcour≈øe, the Dr.
gives you nothing, but his own ≈øuppo≈øitions, and conclu≈øions, for the
proof of his <hi>Minor</hi> propo≈øition which is his manner of
di≈øcour-throughout his booke.</p>
            <p>This argument I an≈øwer; Fir≈øt, by denying the A≈ø≈øumption,
or Minor propo≈øition, and the rea≈øon of my denying all, is becau≈øe the
Scriptures produced by the Doctor, doe not in expre≈ø≈øe words declare, that
there were diver≈øe a≈ø≈øemblies, and Congregations of beleevers in the
Church of Jeru≈øalem, The Scriptures quoted do in expre≈ø≈øe words declare
the contrary to what the Doctor would prove; For, Acts 2.44,46. All that
beleeved were together, and they continued daily with one accord in the Temple.
and Acts. 3.11,12. It is expre≈ø≈øely ≈øaid; That all the people ranne
together to them, in the porch, which is called <hi>Solomons.</hi> Act. 5.12.
And they were all with one accord in <hi>Solomons</hi> Porch. So that the≈øe
Scriptures produced by the Doctor to prove, that there were divers
a≈ø≈øemblies and Congregations of Beleevers in the Church of Jeru≈øalem, who
met together in ≈øeverall places, at one and the ≈øame time, to wit, upon the
fir≈øt day of the week, where they did partake daily in all Ordinances, doth
expre≈øly proove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray, to wit, that the Apo≈øtles, and all the
Beleevers in the Church of Jeru≈øalem, met together with one accord, in one
place, to wit,<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113091:7"/>the Temple, and in <hi>Solomons Porch,</hi>

<hi>quotidie,</hi> day by day, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ≈øtedfa≈øtly in the
Apo≈øtles doctrine, and fellow≈øhip, and in breaking of bread, and in

Doctor him≈øelfe ≈øaith in his <hi>Minor</hi> Propo≈øition, the latter part
of it. <hi>That the Apo≈øtles and all the Beleevers in Ieru≈øalem did
continue daily with one accord in the Temple, and that they brake bread from
hou≈øe to hu≈øe:</hi> And this ≈øhall ≈øuffice for refutation of What the
Docter hath Written touching the fir≈øt Propo≈øition.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond now followes page 81. viz. That all the
Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and ≈øeverall A≈ø≈øemblies made but one Church. And to this
the Doctor ≈øaith, the Brethren them≈øelves acknowledge, that all Beleevers
in Jeru≈øalem were all members of that Church, and they accord further, that
it was but one Church. And it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øt out of the Holy Scripture, Acts
2.3.45.46. chapters. To which I al≈øo con≈øent; But the Brethren have not
acknowledged, neither hath the Doctor by Scripture proved, that in this one
Church of Jeru≈øalem there were aver≈øe Congregations and ≈øeverall
A≈ø≈øemblies of Beleevers; and therein I mu≈øt mnnife≈øt my di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent
from the Doctors opinion, promi≈øing him, that when≈øoever he ≈øhall
≈øoundly prove it by expre≈ø≈øe Words of Scripture (which he hath
undertaken) I will acknowledge it.</p>
            <p>The third propo≈øition, which the Doctor comes next to prove, is,
<hi>That thee Apo≈øtles and Elders, or Pre≈øbyters governed, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
and ruled this Church joyntly and by a common councell and Pre≈øbytery,
pag.</hi> 82. <hi>Which the Doctor ≈øaith is evident by the≈øe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
following: Acts</hi> 11.27. <hi>to the end.</hi> The words of this Sccripture
which the Doctor makes u≈øe of, to prove his A≈ø≈øertion, are the≈øe,
Ver≈øe 30. <hi>And ≈øent it to the Elders by the hands of</hi> Barnabas,
<hi>and</hi> Saul. <hi>Here in the≈øe la≈øt words</hi> (≈øaith the Doctor)
<hi>We ≈øee, that the Presbyters, and none but the Presbyters received the
Almes, which ≈øufficiently proveth, that the Presbyters in all Churches were,
the men of Government: pag.</hi> 82. It is not denied by the Brethren, that the
Presbyters in all Churches were the men in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Churches in
which they are Elders. But this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive (by the Doctors favour) doth not
prove it, to wit; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the Almes was ≈øent to the Elders. Much le≈ø≈øe
doth that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<pb n="12" facs="tcp:113091:8"/>prove, that the Apo≈øtles and
Presbyters governed and ruled the Church in Jeru≈øalem by a Common-councell
and Presbyterie, which is the A≈ø≈øertion that the Doctor undertakes to
prove. <hi>But in the</hi> 15. <hi>Chapter ver≈øe</hi> 2.4.6.22. <hi>and in
chap.</hi> 16.4. <hi>And in Acts</hi> 21.17,18. <hi>The Pre≈øbyters of
Ieru≈øalem by name (≈øaith the Doctor pag.)</hi> 83. <hi>are
expre≈ø≈øed.</hi> Out of which places of Scripture before the Doctor frame
his Arguments, he plea≈øeth to make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈ø≈øion from page 48. to 90.
Wherein he highly extols the Pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, making them equall with the
Apo≈øtles in all the Acts of Church-Governement, (as appeares by the Doctors
owne words, pag. 88. <hi>I doe verily beleeve (≈øaith the Doctor) that the
Presbyters did act as authoritively as the Apo≈øtles: and that the
Pre≈øbyters might as well conclude, It ≈øeemed good to the Holy Gho≈øt and
to us, as well as the Apo≈øtles, and not onely the pre≈øbyters, who ≈øate in
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øell with the Apo≈øtles, and other pre≈øbyters, who were Ordained

e≈øpecially extoll the Presbyters of this kingdom in the≈øe our dais, telling
what they have de≈øerved from the Church, Parliament, and Kingdome more then
any of their Predece≈ø≈øors, having ended his Digre≈ø≈øion, hee gives you
his Argument, pag. 90. To wit: 
<q rend="inline">'They that in the holy Scripture are called
Presbyters, and acted and ordered things in a joynt body, and Common-coun≈øell
with the Presbyters, and exerci≈øed that ordinary power committed to them in
the 18. of <hi>Mattew,</hi> they acted as Presbyters. But the Apo≈øtles in
governing the Church of Jeru≈øalem, con≈øi≈øting of many Congregations and
A≈ø≈øemblies, acted and ordered things in a joynt body and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon councell
with the Presbytery of that Church, as Presbyters. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Church of
Jeru≈øalem was Presbyterianly governed, and by a Common councell of
Presbyters. The <hi>Major,</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> of this Sillogi≈øme being
proved (≈øaith the Doctor) the conclu≈øion will nece≈ø≈øarily en≈øue.</q>
I know not that the Brethren<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113091:8"/>ever denied, That the Church of
Jeru≈øalem was Presbyterianly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned; And although the Dr. be plea≈øed to
make that his conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, yet (under Reformation be it ≈øpoke) that
conclu≈øion doth not follow upon the premi≈øes. For if the Dr. plea≈øe to
review his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, He ≈øhall finde, Fir≈øt; that the ≈øubject of his
<hi>Major</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition is left out both in his <hi>Minor,</hi> and in
his Conclu≈øion: The fir≈øt part of the Doctors <hi>Minor</hi> ≈øhould have
beene this, to witt, But the Apo≈øtles in the holy Scripture are called
Presbyters, and who ever denyed this; Al≈øo the fir≈øt part of the Doctors
conclu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ≈øhould have been this, from the≈øe two premi≈øes, to witt;
<hi>Ergo,</hi> The Apo≈øtles acted as Presbyters which Conclu≈øion is not the
thing in Que≈øtion. Secondly, that from the ≈øecond part of the Doctors two
propo≈øitions (to wit, They that acted and Ordered things in a joynt body and
Common-councell, which the Presbyters, acted as Presbyters; But the Apo≈øtles
in governing the Church of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øalem acted and Ordered things in a joynt
body, and Common-councell with the Presbytery, (or Presbyters either) of that
Church: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Apo≈øtles acted as Presbyters.) This ≈øhould have
been the Doctors conclu≈øion.</p>
            <p>Now the truth is, though the Apo≈øtles were called Presbyters in
the Scripture, yet it followeth not, that they acted as Presbyters, but as
Apo≈øtles Acts 15. And they cannot therein be a pattern and pre≈øident for
Presbyters; Fir≈øt, becau≈øe the Apo≈øtles had the care and charge of and
over all Churches. 2 Cor. 11.28. But the Pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters had the care and
over≈øight of ≈øome one Church onely, as Ephe≈øus Acts 20.28. or Philippi,
Phil. 1.1. and this the Dr. often in≈øerts in his Book. That all the Churches
we read of in the new Te≈øtament (though they were Presbyterially governed)
were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon their ≈øeverall Presbyters, pag. 12.<note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> And ≈øecondly, becau≈øe this would make the
Presbyters Independents indeed, for ≈øo the Apo≈øtles were in the Government
of all the Churches; The Presbyters of Jeru≈øalem, of Ephe≈øus, and of all
the Churches were dependent upon the Apo≈øtles, and the Apo≈øtles onely
depended on Chri≈øt, by who≈øe holy ≈øpirit, they were all alwayes guided in
the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of their Churches, and therefore they ≈øaid Acts 15.28. It
≈øeemed good to the Holy Gho≈øt and us. And though the Doctor ≈øay the
Presbyters might ≈øay ≈øo, as well as the Apo≈øtles becau≈øe the Elders or
Presbyters are mentioned there: The Dr. might have al≈øo con≈øidered that the
Brethren, even the whole church, the multitude (how many ≈øoever the D. can
make of them) were pre≈øent as wel as<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113091:9"/>the Presbyters. Acts
15.4.12.22.23.25.27.28. And ≈øo have made the Brethren, the multitude, even
the whole Church Independent al≈øo; and the Dr. might as well have affirmed,
that the Brethren even the whole Church might ≈øay, It ≈øeemed good to the
Holy Gho≈øt and to us.</p>
            <p>To the fourth propo≈øition; 
<q rend="inline">'That the Church of Jeru≈øalem and the Government
of the ≈øame, is to be a pattern for all Congregations and A≈ø≈øemblies in
any City or vicinity to unite into one Church, and for the Officers and
Presbyters of tho≈øe congregations to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern that Church joyntly in a
Colledge or Presbytery. pag. 97.</q> And for the proof of this fourth
Propo≈øition, the Doctor ≈øaith; 
<q rend="inline">'That all men acknowledge, that the mother Church
mu≈øt give an example of Government to all the Daughter Churches. Neither do
the Brethren deny (≈øaith the Dr.) but the Government of the Church of
Jeru≈øalem mu≈øt be the pattern of Government to all Churches.</q> But the
Dr. knowes, that the Brethren deny that the Church of Ieru≈øalem con≈øi≈øted
of divers Congregations and ≈øeverall a≈ø≈øemblies under a Common-councell,
Con≈øi≈øtory, Colledge, or Court of Presbyters. And this they have not
granted, neither hath the Doctor proved. And this may be ≈øufficient to be
≈øaid in an≈øwer to the four Propo≈øitions touching the fir≈øt
que≈øtion.</p>
            <p>And now I come to the ≈øecond Que≈øtion, which is concerning the
manner of gathering of Churches, and admitting of Members and Officers pag. 98.
which Que≈øtion the Dr. thus ≈øtates, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">'Whether Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpell may, out of

98.99. Wherein the judicious Reader may perceive the Doctor (through
mi≈ø-information I conceive) hath mi≈øtaken the ≈øtateing of the Que≈øtion,
which he partly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth pag. 100.</p>
            <p>

with the method our Brethren (the Independents) u≈øe, &amp;c.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113091:9"/>And to this purpo≈øe the Doctor begins with Chri≈øts
commi≈øsion, Matth. 28.19,20. and Mark. 16.15,16. and Acts
26.15,16.17,18,19,20.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Out of the≈øe ≈øeverall Scriptures the Doctor ob≈øerves the≈øe
three things, pag. 101. and 102. To wit, Fir≈øt, 
<q rend="inline">'That they ≈øhould teach no other things but what
Chri≈øt commanded them, and appeared to them in, and for which thy had his
Word and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. Secondly, the condition, which they were to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound unto
all nations and people, upon which they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Church, was
Faith, Repentance, and Bapti≈øme. And thirdly, that this commi≈ø≈øion was
delivered onely to the Apo≈øtles and Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpel, that they
≈øhould admit who≈øoever beleeved, and were baptized; And they that beleeved
not would not be baptized, were not to be admitted. The≈øe are the Doctors
owne words, page 102. and page. 103. The Doctor for proofe quotes the third
Chapter of Matthew, and Luke 3.7. And the ≈øum of <hi>Iohns</hi> preaching
(≈øaith the Dr.) is mentioned, ver≈øe 3. It was the bapti≈øme of Repentance
for the Remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øinnes. Al≈øo he there cites Luke 7.29. That all
the people that heard him, and the Publicans ju≈øtified God, being Baptized
with the Bapti≈øme of <hi>Iohn;</hi> But the Phari≈øees and the Lawyers
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the councell of God again≈øt them≈øelves, being no Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized of
him. page 103.104. But now to go on (≈øaith the Dr. pag 104.) after the
Re≈øurrection and A≈ø≈øen≈øion of Chri≈øt, &amp;c. Where he quotes, Acts
2.37,38. Then they that gladly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Word were Baptized, and the ≈øame
day were added unto them about three thou≈øand ≈øoules.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Hence the Doctor ob≈øerves, that the Apo≈øtles propounded no
other condition or termes for the making all and every one of them members of
the Church, but Repentance and Bapti≈øme, <hi>The which, when the people had
accepted of (≈øaith the Doctor) They were forthwith admitted, &amp;c.
page.</hi> 104. For another proofe the Doctor produceth, Acts 10.44,47,48.
Where the Doctor affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, page 106. <hi>That tho≈øe Brethren who came
with</hi> Peter <hi>did not intermeddle in that bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, to wit, of
their admittance (by Bapti≈øme) into the Church.</hi> Now I conceive the
rea≈øon, why tho≈øe Brethren did not intermeddle to hinder their admittance
to that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113091:10"/>of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, (to wit, Bapti≈øme
in water) and ≈øo to an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Church; was, not becau≈øe they had

            </p>
            <p>That the Brethren had a liberty to have declared any thing, which
might ju≈øtly have hindred the admini≈øtration of that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of

expounded. ver≈øe 47. <hi>Can any man forbid water that the≈øe ≈øhould not

               <q rend="inline">'And the Dr. him≈øelfe acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, pag. 102.

untill <hi>Barnabas</hi> witne≈ø≈øed his condition and conver≈øation to the

               <q rend="inline">'Fir≈øt, That Chri≈øt having given a

or tearmes, which they were to propound unto all Nations and people upon which,
they were to be admitted into the Church, were Faith, Repentance, and
Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øme. Mark. 16.15,16. For the commi≈ø≈øion was delivered to the

enter into the Church by way of a particular covenant, pag. 105. <hi>Acts</hi>
2.37.38.</q> This being the ≈øumme and re≈øult of that method and practice,
which the Dr. conceives ≈øhould be done in gathering Churches and admitting
Members, which the Scriptures will warrant, and Chri≈øt Je≈øus approve of as
his fathers will, I ≈øhall now take liberty to declare, what I know by mine
own experience to be the practice of ≈øome Churches of God in this City. That
≈øo both the Dr. and the Reader may judge how near the Saints, who walk
together in the Fellow≈øhip of the Go≈øpell do come in their practice, to
the≈øe Apo≈øtolicall rules and practice propounded by the Dr. as Gods method
in gathering Churches, and admitting Members. I ≈øay, that I know by mine own
experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (having walked with them) That they were thus gathered;
<hi>viz.</hi> Some godly and learned men of approved guifts and abilities for
the Mini≈øterie, being driven out of the Countries, where they lived by the
per≈øecution of the Prelates, came to ≈øojourn in this great City, and
preached the Word of God both publikely, and from hou≈øe to hou≈øe, and daily
in the Temples and in every hou≈øe, they cea≈øed not to teach and preach
Je≈øus Chri≈øt: and ≈øome of them have dwelt in their own hired hou≈øes,

the method of God, and practice of the Apo≈øtles in gathering of Churches, and
admitting Members, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcionably practi≈øed by his Brethren of both
≈øides according to the revealed Word and Will of the Father.</p>
